          The purpose of this project is to raise stroke awareness, as many people will have one in their lifetime.
We will use data science to analyze how certain factors may cause you to have a stroke.
We originally had high accuracy but the model would only predict “no stroke.”
We addressed this with oversampling (SMOTE) and got high recall but lower accuracy.
The models used are Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifiers, and Neural Networks.
Our next step is to use web development to communicate our results to others.
